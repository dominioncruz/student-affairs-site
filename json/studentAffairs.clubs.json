  "about": "The PAU Public Speaking Club is an extra-curricular club based within the premises of the Ibeju-Lekki campus of Pan-Atlantic University. It was set up in 2017 to address the issues faced by students in the university community in the aspect of speaking and expressing themselves publicly.\nIn the 7 years of its existence, the club has helped students learn the rudiments of speaking, having conversations, presenting on topics with slides, debating, and giving speeches on topics (whether impromptu or prepared) and has allowed them to learn more about current events and their society.\nThe club meets twice a month - on the second and fourth Sunday of every month at 4 pm, with activities (games, presentations, and so on) centered around key themes to improve speaking skills.\nTo revive the debate culture in its base university, the public speaking club would like to continue the annual series - an inter-departmental debate competition to foster a competitive spirit among students at the university and improve the atmosphere of the school with an engaging event, while also promoting the club’s activities.",

This also involves creating a space where members can encourage each other to be more consistent with the culture of reading.\nOver the course of the semester, we engage in various activities such as selecting a theme for the month and reading selected books in accordance with that theme, participating in group discussions, organizing reading challenges, trivia’s and quizzes. To add a more fun element to it all, we also have movie nights from time to time!\nFor a more personal touch, we may host author talks or literary events, which also extends to any in-house readers who may want a safe space to share their work. That’s to say, the Book Club also promotes creative expression, often inspiring members to write their own stories or reviews based on the books they read.\nIt’s never a dull time at ‘The Book Club’!",
